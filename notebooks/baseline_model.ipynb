      "I agree with Emerson that if you try to do something different of what you are doing, you will grow. However, if you cap doing that same thing, you will never grow. For example, in life, you do different things to know more about that world, you experiment with different things to know things that other people don't know, to become a strong person. Doing different things, you will grow. For example, when you become a father and a man, you change your experiment things that you never imagined how that works. Like some people, they still act like kids because they talk to young men like their age is 17 and 19, this you men they still don't know how to act like men, when their age is 40, that's how you will never grow. Because a man changes to a man is when he is 25, this is that age that you are changing things, and that's the way people get old and they still act like kids. Other people grow fast because I think that the way that family teaches, like in all families, they are not the same, they grow in different types. Like some families star teach to their kids things that they don't be doing, try to teach the better things. For example, when they are having dinner all together in a restaurant, some parents talk to their kids before they go in. They are having the food they need to be put off they table & phone, to not talk when they have food in their mause at that time, you start grow. In the culture, you be different that other people. Like when you go to other houses, you will be a better person for example, your friend, they say, hey what are you going to do after school, you like to have dinner with my family, you know more better that how your parent teach when you are kids. Because when you are young men, and you still know how that works, you will cap doing that way how you learn. Like other families, they don't that, when they are eat, they use table & phone that way you will never grow, you get to old person, and you will cap doing that same thing that you be doing when you where a kids and I think you main, don't grow.\n",

      "It was during the summers of 1948 and 1949 that I drifted down from Saskatchewan and joined up with Seagoing Cowboys, an outfit dedicated to sending agricultural commodities to war-torn countries. The commodities were paid for by the recipient countries, chiefly England, France and Holland, and the ships were supplied by private U.S. companies. The only qualification for enrolment in the Seagoing Cowboys was that a man must be able to heft fifty pounds of grain in a sack over his shoulder, march with it to the top of the ship's hold, and dump it into a bin. When that was done, he was entitled to a passage anywhere the ship was going. I liked the free trip, of course, but there were other inducements. My father had died when I was fourteen, and I had a widowed mother to support. There was only 160 acres of land and it didn't take much management, but there was a house on it and that had to be looked after. So I picked the nearest seaport, graded the grain bins, and went down to the shipping office to sign up for the next trip. The work on the ships wasn't hard. There were a few experienced longshoremen to show us what to do, and the cattle were always shipped in pens. All we had to do was to get the animals from the stockyards onto the ships and then down into the holds. The cows were wild as deer, having never seen anything like a ship before, and they didn't like the narrow gangplanks. Every once in a while, a cow would balk on the gangplank and we would have to prod and shove to get her moving again. But once they got used to the ship, they were all right. The trip from New Orleans to Antwerp took twenty-one days. We had good food and a comfortable bunk in the crew's quarters. And there was plenty of time to learn how to play poker and blackjack and to teach the cats how to play ping-pong. I saw a lot of the world on those ships. I was on a Liberty ship once that was loaded with wheat in New Orleans and then sailed to Antwerp. From there, the wheat was transferred to a Dutch ship and we brought a cargo of Dutch cheese back to New Orleans. Another time, I was\n",

      "When peoples ask for advices, they somtimes talks to mor than one person. This is a good idear because it can helps them make a beter choise. For example, lets say sombody wants to know if they should get a dog or a cat. They ask they're friends and family for they're opinions. One person says dogs are beter because they are more loyal, but another person says cats are beter because they are more independent. This person now has two diffrent perspectives and can think about which one is more important to them. Maybe they decide that they want a pet that is more independent, so they choose a cat. Another example, lets say sombody wants to know if they should take a job offer. They ask they're co-workers and they're boss for they're opinions. One person says the job offer is a good idear because it pays more, but another person says it's not a good idear because the company has a bad reputation. This person now has two diffrent perspectives and can think about which one is more important to them. Maybe they decide that they want a job with a good reputation, so they don't take the job offer. Seeking multiple opinions can also helps people to see things that they might not have thought about before. For example, if someone asks for advice on how to decorate they're room, one person might suggest using bright colors, while another person might suggest using neutral colors. This person now has two diffrent ideas and can think about which one is more suitable for they're room. In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can helps people make a beter choise because it gives them diffrent perspectives and ideas. It also helps them to see things that they might not have thought about before. So, next time you need to make a choise, don't be affraid to ask for advices from mor than one person.\n",

      "I think drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving. It's really dangerous and a lot of people get injured or even killed from accidents caused by distracted driving. I know some people might say that it's important to be able to answer calls or texts while driving, but it's just not worth the risk. First of all, using a cell phone while driving takes away from the driver's attention on the road. When you're driving, your eyes should be on the road and your hands should be on the wheel. But when you're on your phone, you're not paying attention to what's happening around you. You might not see that car stopping in front of you or that pedestrian crossing the street. It's just too dangerous. Another thing is that using a cell phone while driving is a big distraction. When you're texting or scrolling through social media, you're not focused on driving. You might be looking at your phone instead of the road, and that's when accidents happen. It's like driving blindfolded. Also, think about how fast you're going when you're driving. You could be going 60 miles per hour or even faster. That means that if you're distracted by your phone, you could be driving for a long time without even realizing it. You could be missing red lights, stop signs, and other important signs on the road. Furthermore, a lot of states have laws against using cell phones while driving. They know how dangerous it is, and they don't want people to die or get hurt. If it's illegal, it must be bad. I know some people might say that they need to be able to use their phone for work or emergencies. But there are ways around that. You could use a hands-free device or have a passenger answer the phone for you. Or you could just pull over to a safe place and then answer the phone. It's not that hard. In conclusion, using a cell phone while driving is too dangerous and should not be allowed. It's a major distraction and takes away from the driver's attention on the road. It's also illegal in a lot of places, and there are ways to avoid having to use your phone while driving. Drivers should just focus on driving and leave their phones alone.\n",

      "The sky was a clear blue, and the sun was shining brightly as I walked to school. The air was crisp and clean, and I could hear the birds singing in the trees. It was a beautiful day, and I was feeling good. As I got closer to school, I saw a group of kids gathered around a car. They were all talking and laughing, and the car was blaring music. I could tell that they were having a good time. I stopped to watch them for a moment. I thought about how much I loved cars. They were so powerful and fun to drive. I couldn't imagine my life without them. But then I thought about all the problems that cars cause. They pollute the air, they contribute to climate change, and they cause traffic accidents. I realized that maybe it was time for me to reconsider my love of cars. I started to think about all the ways that we could limit car usage. We could build more bike lanes and make it easier for people to walk or take public transportation. We could raise the price of gas to discourage people from driving. We could even start a car-free day once a week. I know that limiting car usage would be difficult, but it's something that we need to do. For the sake of our planet and our future, we need to find ways to get people out of their cars. I continued on my way to school, thinking about all the ways that we could limit car usage.

Generally, chromatography is a simple way of identifying an unknown mixture of chemicals or compounds, which are in liquid or gas form, by dissolving mixtures in a fluid called the mobile phase that carries through the stationary phase. The mobile phase can be a proper liquid solvent or mixture of solvents, while the stationary phase is a solid or liquid phase that is fixed in a place in the experiment. In our lab, we used a specific chromatography called paper chromatography. What I learned during this lab, in general, is that paper chromatography works based on capillary action. Capillary action is the tendency of liquid to rise in thin tubes or to be brought into small openings; It happens because there are adhesive forces between the molecules of the solvent. In paper chromatography, the liquid rises up through the paper, which is the stationary medium, since there are small holes in between the paper fibres. The main point of chromatography, however, is that it uses the difference in solubility of substances in a solvent. Solubility basically means how much of a particular substance can dissolve in a specific solvent, and the difference of it creates the various substances to leave solution at varying points as the solvent rises up the stationary phase. In this case, I noticed that the substance will travel more if it is more soluble. Also, absorption takes part in creating separation. Higher absorption to the stationary phase will slow down the molecule that moves through the column.'\n",

      "Text: 'In this lab, we used a technique called paper chromatography to separate and identify metal ions. Chromatography is a method used to analyze mixtures of chemicals by separating them based on how they move through two phases: a mobile phase (a liquid or gas that moves) and a stationary phase (a solid or liquid fixed in place). In our experiment, the stationary phase was the paper, and the mobile phase was the solvent. Paper chromatography works mainly due to capillary action, which is the ability of a liquid to flow through narrow spaces without external force. This happens because of adhesive forces between the liquid molecules and the paper fibers. As the solvent rises up the paper, it carries the dissolved substances with it. The key principle of chromatography is that different substances have different solubilities in the solvent and different levels of absorption (or attraction) to the stationary phase. Substances that are more soluble in the solvent travel farther up the paper, while substances that are more strongly absorbed by the paper move more slowly. From this lab, I learned that paper chromatography separates substances based on their solubility and their interaction with the stationary phase.'\n",

      "Text: 'In this lab, I learned about how the system shifts to alleviate stress which allows the system to reach a new equilibrium. When we add a chemical species, the equilibrium system will remove the added species by shifting to the other side while the equilibrium system will replace the species by shifting if we remove some of the chemical species by the process of neutralizing, complex ion formation, or producing precipitate. This is due to a change in concentration; when concentration increases, the reaction rate increases the frequency of collision while it does opposite when concentration decreases. In the addition of a chemical species, ions considered as spectator ions did not affect the shift. Furthermore, temperature change would affect frequency of collision and fraction of successful collision which would affect the reaction rate. When a system is heated, the system will shift toward the endothermic direction in order to remove added energy while the system will shift toward the exothermic side to replace lost energy when the system is cooled. In general, the endothermic side is more sensitive to the temperature change due to its high activation energy. When we were determining the effects of the stress, we had to depend on our observations. We basically kept track of the colour changes or formation of precipitation to determine the shifts in the system. The colours became visible when we diluted the solution. In addition, I learned that kinetics can go along with Le Chatelier’s Principle. When the system is stressed, the forward and reverse reaction rates would both increase or decrease. However, they would have different magnitudes. For example, when we removed the species, the concentration of the reactants had a lower concentration so that the frequency of collision decreased; this decreased the forward rate more than the reverse rate so that it caused a left shift to occur.

      "Text: 'In this lab, I learned how a chemical system responds to stress in order to re-establish equilibrium, according to Le Chatelier's Principle. When a chemical species is added, the system shifts to the opposite side to reduce the increase. Conversely, when a species is removed—through neutralization, complex ion formation, or precipitation—the system shifts to replace what was removed. This happens because changes in concentration affect the reaction rate by altering the frequency of collisions between particles. Spectator ions, however, do not influence the direction of the shift. I also learned how temperature affects equilibrium. A temperature increase causes the system to shift toward the endothermic direction to absorb excess energy, while cooling shifts the equilibrium toward the exothermic direction to release energy. The endothermic side is generally more sensitive to temperature changes because it has a higher activation energy. To determine how the equilibrium shifted, we relied on observations of color changes or the formation of precipitates. Diluting the solution often made these color changes more visible. Additionally, I learned that reaction kinetics work alongside equilibrium: when a system is stressed, both the forward and reverse reaction rates change, but not equally. For example, removing a reactant decreases its concentration and collision frequency, reducing the forward rate more than the reverse rate. This results in a shift toward the left, or the reactant side.'\n",

In this case, I noticed that the substance will travel more if it is more soluble. Also, absorption takes part in creating separation. Higher absorption to the stationary phase will slow down the molecule that moves through the column.\",\n",

    "    \"In this lab, we used a technique called paper chromatography to separate and identify metal ions. Chromatography is a method used to analyze mixtures of chemicals by separating them based on how they move through two phases: a mobile phase (a liquid or gas that moves) and a stationary phase (a solid or liquid fixed in place). In our experiment, the stationary phase was the paper, and the mobile phase was the solvent. Paper chromatography works mainly due to capillary action, which is the ability of a liquid to flow through narrow spaces without external force. This happens because of adhesive forces between the liquid molecules and the paper fibers. As the solvent rises up the paper, it carries the dissolved substances with it. The key principle of chromatography is that different substances have different solubilities in the solvent and different levels of absorption (or attraction) to the stationary phase. Substances that are more soluble in the solvent travel farther up the paper, while substances that are more strongly absorbed by the paper move more slowly. From this lab, I learned that paper chromatography separates substances based on their solubility and their interaction with the stationary phase.\",\n",

    "    \"In this lab, I learned about how the system shifts to alleviate stress which allows the system to reach a new equilibrium. When we add a chemical species, the equilibrium system will remove the added species by shifting to the other side while the equilibrium system will replace the species by shifting if we remove some of the chemical species by the process of neutralizing, complex ion formation, or producing precipitate. This is due to a change in concentration; when concentration increases, the reaction rate increases the frequency of collision while it does opposite when concentration decreases. In the addition of a chemical species, ions considered as spectator ions did not affect the shift. Furthermore, temperature change would affect frequency of collision and fraction of successful collision which would affect the reaction rate. When a system is heated, the system will shift toward the endothermic direction in order to remove added energy while the system will shift toward the exothermic side to replace lost energy when the system is cooled. In general, the endothermic side is more sensitive to the temperature change due to its high activation energy. When we were determining the effects of the stress, we had to depend on our observations. We basically kept track of the colour changes or formation of precipitation to determine the shifts in the system. The colours became visible when we diluted the solution. In addition, I learned that kinetics can go along with Le Chatelier’s Principle. When the system is stressed, the forward and reverse reaction rates would both increase or decrease. However, they would have different magnitudes. For example, when we removed the species, the concentration of the reactants had a lower concentration so that the frequency of collision decreased; this decreased the forward rate more than the reverse rate so that it caused a left shift to occur. \",\n",

    "    \"In this lab, I learned how a chemical system responds to stress in order to re-establish equilibrium, according to Le Chatelier's Principle. When a chemical species is added, the system shifts to the opposite side to reduce the increase. Conversely, when a species is removed—through neutralization, complex ion formation, or precipitation—the system shifts to replace what was removed. This happens because changes in concentration affect the reaction rate by altering the frequency of collisions between particles. Spectator ions, however, do not influence the direction of the shift. I also learned how temperature affects equilibrium. A temperature increase causes the system to shift toward the endothermic direction to absorb excess energy, while cooling shifts the equilibrium toward the exothermic direction to release energy. The endothermic side is generally more sensitive to temperature changes because it has a higher activation energy. To determine how the equilibrium shifted, we relied on observations of color changes or the formation of precipitates. Diluting the solution often made these color changes more visible. Additionally, I learned that reaction kinetics work alongside equilibrium: when a system is stressed, both the forward and reverse reaction rates change, but not equally. For example, removing a reactant decreases its concentration and collision frequency, reducing the forward rate more than the reverse rate. This results in a shift toward the left, or the reactant side.\"\n",

    "The TF-IDF baseline achieved a 99.39% accuracy on the validation set. However, qualitative analysis revealed that this high score is due to overfitting on simple, dataset-specific character n-grams like 'cause' (human) and 'like,' (LLM). The model fails to generalize, incorrectly classifying new, human-written sentences as LLM-generated. This proves that a simple lexical model is insufficient and justifies the need for the proposed Text-CNN to learn deeper, more robust semantic and structural patterns."
